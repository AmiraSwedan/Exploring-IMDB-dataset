This dataset was generated from The Movie Database API. This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
Their API also provides access to data on many additional movies, actors and actresses, crew members, and TV shows.

## Packages 
- pandas (0.19.2)
- numpy (1.15.0)
- matplotlib(2.2.2)
- seaborn(0.9.0)

## Objectives
In this notebook I try to answer the below questions: 
- which movies genres gain the highest popularity in IMDP ?
- Is there any association between movies revenue and users voting in IMDB?
- Which year recorded the highest / lowest level of revenue?


## Findings
1) The documentary and music movies recorded the highest average of users votes in IMDP, in the contrary the horror and science finction movies
2) The higher budget allocated for the movies, the higher revenue obtained with some exception, where there are some movies produced with a very high budget but didn't acheive the desired revenue. In the contrary, some movies achieved a very high level of revenue though they didn't have a reletively big budget.
3) Avatar, Star Wars and Titanic are ranked as the top movies in IMDP in terms of users votes and revenue.
4) The Warrior's Way, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End are ranked as the top movies in IMDP in terms of budgeting.
